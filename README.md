## vTail React Native Programming Task

Thank you for considering vTail! We are building a next-generation telehealth platform and would love for you to join our engineering team.

In order to be considered for the developer position, we invite you to complete the following task.

_Note: You should aim to spend only 2 - 3 hours at the most on this task._

### Preparation

Before starting this task, we recommend that you have:

- Your favourite computer and development tools / IDE to hand;
- A few hours of un-distracted time ahead of you;
- Access to the internet;
- A mug of hot coffee (or tea, if you prefer!).

### In this task, please use:

- `create-react-native-app`, do not use Expo.
- Typescript
- Your favourite OSS modules to help with common tasks
- The internet, including Google, Stackoverflow etc to help with the task!
- Any type of data storage
- And include some unit tests using your favourite framework.
- Don't worry about running on any devices, simulator/emulator is fine.

You may also ask us any general questions you might have about the task.

## The Task

1. Create a simple app to allow a basic Olympic Medals Table to be displayed
2. The app should allow:
   -- Countries to be added to a table, along with the TOTAL number of medals of each Gold/Bronze/Silver the country won during the last Olympic Games; and
   -- Rows to be sorted in descending order of medals won, either automatically or manually by the user.
3. Commit and Push your code to a new public Github repository
4. Send us the link
5. Your code will be reviewed by one of our senior technical team and we will get back to you.

If you wish to supply instructions on how to run or understand the construction of your app, then please provide those in a new README.md file.

### For bonus points:

If you find the task above easy, then feel free to improve your app. Here are some ideas:

- Add counts for each type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and make the countries order by Gold first, Silver next and Bronze thereafter;
- Add country flag icons/images to the country names;
- Allow editing and/or deleting of countries from the list.

### Any questions?

Please just ask.
Good luck and thanks for taking the time to complete this task!
